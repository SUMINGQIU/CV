          <h2>Hello.</h2>
          <p class = "introduction">Hi! Nice to meet you. I received my Bachelor of Science degree in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics from Lanzhou University. 
            I am now pursuing my Master of Science degree in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering with a Minor in Computer Science at Cornell University. 
            I have held seven pieces of research programs in my undergraduate years and also published three papers. 
            My research interests cover friction, FEA, and mechanical designs. Now I am working on computer vision and Unreal Engines.
            I am very passionate about interdisciplinary things empowered by physics, computer science, and math. 
            Combining these together and making more productive things attract me a lot. 
            In many of my projects, you can see how I combine different knowledge together. 
            In the future, I wish to explore interesting interdisciplinary in greater depth.</p>

                  <li>Implemented Deep Learning based (Mono Depth) terrain recognition algorithm and Detectron2 algorithm applicable to RGB camera imagery,
                    which are used to generate a depth map for obstacle avoidance and segmentation for classifications respectively.</li>
                  <li>Used Rapidly Exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm for 2D path planning after achieving the obstacle map from above.</li>
                  <li>Designed target tracking strategy for drones and ground robots using robot path planning methods.</li>
                  <li>Designed the human-robot collaboration system (LMCO project) for agents tracking as human operators will help drones to update route for
                    unseen obstacles like glass doors or when drones lost the target in foggy and rainy weathers.</li>
                  <li>Created collaborative platform between human and robots where robots respond to virtual avatar controlled by human using VR autonomously.</li>
                  <li>Analyzed images captured by virtual robot using real time key-point detection algorithm and sent control commands back to the virtual robots
                    which enabled targets tracking and obstacles avoidance.</li>
                  <li>Realized interaction of virtual drones and ground robots with physical targets, which is the basis for virtual interaction with the real world.</li>
